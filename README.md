# Discord Kahoot Flooder

"Workers" constantly send bots to a kahoot game. I integrated this with a discord bot, so all you have to do to use it, is create a discord bot, then run it and use a command to flood a game!

## Requirements

You need to have python installed, watch a youtube video for this if you don't know how.
You also need nodejs installed, you can watch a youtube video for this as well.

## Installation

Download the project as a .zip file, then extract to a folder

Before running the commands, make sure you put your bots token in the token.txt file!

```bash
cd folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm i concurrently
```

## Running the script

```bash
python main.py
```
